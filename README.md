# Item Tracker

Have you ever come across a situation that you cannot remember that the wine you tried last time and you hated it? and eventually get the exactly same wine? If you keep forgetting things? This app is going to be perfect for you! Click [here](https://fierce-coast-17597.herokuapp.com/)

# Approach

My web app is only going to work with login, if you tried to access to different routes manually, it will fall to the login page by default.
You can add a cateogry and delete the categories, you can add, edit and delete items within the category.
I really wanted to explore making an app using react and ruby! This was quite challenging as I want React to handle the client side being UI and rails is handling just api calls. I wanted to use various different new features that I haven't had much experience of. I used 'context' to handle my global states and used 'hooks' for handling most of the state. It was a very good practice for me to understand these features.

# Consideration

I have to think about all the sinarios such as when the data is loading and is done loading and the data is actually exist or not. Also, I wanted users to fill all of the sections when they create or edit. I replaced the forms with material UI modals for aesthetical pleasing. 


# What's Next

I am going to work on the search feature to find the items and sort by feature according to 'rating - descending' and 'cost'.
